# Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security issue in reduxlite, please report it by sending an
email to [rm.rf.etc@gmail.com](mailto:rm.rf.etc@gmail.com).

This will allow us to assess the risk, and make a fix available before we add a
bug report to the GitHub repository.

Thanks for helping make reduxlite safe for everyone.
